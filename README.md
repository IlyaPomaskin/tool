## üîß Configuration

### Whisper Models
- The app automatically uses the first `.bin` model found in the `models/` directory
- Recommended models for different use cases:
  - `ggml-base.bin` (~140MB) - good balance of speed/quality
  - `ggml-small.bin` (~460MB) - better quality
  - `ggml-tiny.bin` (~39MB) - fastest, lower quality

### OpenAI API (Fallback)
1. Get API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Set environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```
3. Used automatically if local Whisper fails

### Permissions
On first launch, macOS will request permissions:
- **Microphone access** - for voice recording
- **Accessibility features** - for global hotkeys
